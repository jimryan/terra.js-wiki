Welcome to the Terra.js documentation.

Terra.js seeks to provide a compatible way to work with the Terra blockchain within JavaScript runtimes such as Node.js and the browser. The main functionalities of Terra.js are:

- deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods
- serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format
- providing access to the `terrad` node API (LCD) from a JavaScript-based interface
- additional utilities such as hash functions and key signing algorithms
